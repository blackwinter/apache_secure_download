= apache_secure_download - Apache module providing secure downloading functionality, just like Mongrel Secure Download does for mongrel.

== VERSION

This documentation refers to apache_secure_download version 0.1.0


== DESCRIPTION

Place the following snippet in your Apache config:

  # protect files by Apache Secure Download
  <IfModule mod_ruby.c>
    RubyRequire apache/ruby-run

    RubyRequire /path/to/apache_secure_download
    # or
    #RubyRequire rubygems
    #RubyRequire apache/secure_download

    <Location /secure>
      # pass your shared secret string to the handler -- secret means SECRET!
      RubyAccessHandler Apache::SecureDownload.new("secret")
    </Location>
  </IfModule>

And create links to your resources with timestamp and token:

  require 'apache/secure_download/util'

  timestamp = 1.minute.from_now  # e.g.
  token     = Apache::SecureDownload::Util.token("secret", path, timestamp)

  url = path + "?timestamp=#{timestamp}&token=#{token}"

  # or simply use the provided helper:
  url = Apache::SecureDownload::Util.secure_url("secret", path, 1.minute.from_now)

  # make resulting URL cacheable for 30 seconds (on average):
  url = Apache::SecureDownload::Util.secure_url("secret", path, :expires => 1.minute.from_now, :cache => 30)

  # specify expiration time using an offset (results in Time.now + 60; also includes caching for 60 seconds):
  url = Apache::SecureDownload::Util.secure_url("secret", path, :offset => 60)

See Apache::SecureDownload::Util.secure_url for more examples.
